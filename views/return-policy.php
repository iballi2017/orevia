                    <aside><strong>Melted products: -</strong> Our shea butter-based products are made to melt at body
                        temperature
                        for it to
                        be
                        easily absorbed by the skin. These products could occasionally melt during transit, however, if
                        this
                        is the
                        case, kindly put the product into the fridge or freezer for a while before using it again.
