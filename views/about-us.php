                    Orevia started in the year 2017 where it was specially created for family and friends and after
                    several
                    positive
                    reviews, we went commercial in 2019. So far it has been an interesting journey as we look forward to
                    making
                    greater impact in skin care and we havenâ€™t looked back ever since.
                    Orevia skin care products are made from a blend of natural ingredients that are carefully formulated
                    to deliver value, quality and consistency. These ingredients are sourced from our great nation
                    Nigeria, which is blessed with a large number of natural and organic produce such as shea butter
                    and coconut oil to name a few. alongside other natural products</p>
